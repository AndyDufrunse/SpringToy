# SpringToy
    Today is the first day for me to  really use the github-"Cat".
    This is a tiny toy of Spring Framework, it's the FIRST time for me to study and use the Framework, so amazing it is. 
    I am just a primary coder, knowing little of programming. No pains, no gains, now, I want to get it!
